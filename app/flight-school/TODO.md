# TODO for Implementing SectionTwo

- [x] Edit app/flight-school/sections/index.css: Add background-image rule for #flight-school-section2 using /assets/images/flight-school/image-3.jpg, with cover size and fixed attachment.
- [x] Edit app/flight-school/sections/SectionTwo.js: Import flightSchoolContent from '@/lib/data', add content display using currentIndex (heading from contentOne, description from contentTwo and contentThree), add navigation buttons (prev/next) to update currentIndex.
- [x] Update TODO.md: Mark steps as completed.
- [ ] Test: Run the app and verify scroll, background, and navigation.
