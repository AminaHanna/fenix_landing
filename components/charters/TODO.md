# TODO for Charters SectionFour Form Update

## Breakdown of Approved Plan
1. **Fix bugs and typos**: Correct `bookigFormName` to `bookingFormName` in booking forms (desktop/mobile), fix mobile enquiry phone setter to `setEnquiryFormMob`, add `type="submit"` to all buttons, ensure inputs have `value` and `required`.
2. **Simplify enquiry form**: Remove Company and Message fields from both desktop and mobile enquiry forms to match image (keep Name, Email, Phone).
3. **Update submit button**: Change "Sent" to "Submit" for enquiry forms, style as full-width gold button at bottom.
4. **Update handler**: Adjust `handleEnquiry` console.log for simplified fields.
5. **Test and verify**: Confirm rendering, functionality, no errors; test desktop/mobile, submission.

Progress: All completed.
